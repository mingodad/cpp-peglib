Introduction
============
Aurochs is a parser generator that uses the parse expression grammar (PEG) or
"packrat" approach. It takes a grammar in a BNF-like notation (a .peg file) and
produces bytecode (a .nog file) for a stack automaton. This bytecode is later
interpreted on the input to parse using a C library. Bindings are given for
Ocaml, Java and Exascript. Aurochs can also directly produce C or Ocaml code
for parsing.

Copyright and authors
=====================
Aurochs has been developed at Exalead SA for our internal parsing needs.
Its developer is Berke Durak. Some contributions to the Java binding have
been made by Maxime Van Noppen.

Its home page is at http://aurochs.fr/
or at the [alternate site](http://aurochs.fr.mirrorz.com/).

A bit of code:
%{
  let x = 33

How to use Aurochs
==================
Aurochs processes a parse expression grammar file, usually with a {.peg} extension.
In contrast to traditional parser generators such as Bison or Yacc, Aurochs can be used without having to write a single
line of program code.  You just have to write your grammar files.
In fact, there are many different ways to use Aurochs:
  - Use Aurochs to as a kind of grep or sed; you provide it with a grammar file {grammar.peg} and an input file {file.txt},
    and it parses the given file with the given grammar, outputting the XML-ish parse tree to stdout.
  - Use Aurochs to generate a parser automaton.  The automaton is saved in a file {grammar.nog} and can then be used with the
    Aurochs libraries, from Ocaml, Java or directly from C.
  - Use Aurochs to generate a parser in Ocaml, C or amd64 assembly code.
  - Use Aurochs to generate a stub code for Ocaml.
